      <section class="about">
        Hello, my name is Marcos Elias and I recently graduated from San Diego
        State with a Bachelors in Computer Science. I like to both watch and
        play sports and I like to play the guitar. During my time at SDSU, I had
        the opportunity to work on various projects, including Unity game
        development and Arduino programming. Additionally, I took a class that
        involved challenging Unix/Linux labs, which pushed me to become
        comfortable in a Linux environment. I also created a website after
        completing CodePath's 'Intro to Web Development' course. Currently, I am
        dedicating my time to completing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses
        from codewithmosh.com so that I can further enhance my skills and gain
        proficiency. I am passionate about Front-End Web Development and I am
        eager to secure an entry-level position so that I can gain experience
        and sharpen my skills.
