          <p>
            Hello, my name is Marcos Elias and I recently graduated from San
            Diego State with a
            <span class="highlight--primary">Bachelors in Computer Science</span
            >. I like to both watch and play sports and I like to play the
            guitar.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            During my time at SDSU, I had the opportunity to work on various
            projects, including Unity game development and Arduino programming.
            Additionally, I took a class that involved challenging Unix/Linux
            labs, which pushed me to become comfortable in a Linux environment.
            I also created a website after completing CodePath's 'Intro to Web
            Development' course.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            Currently, I am enrolled in
            <span class="highlight--primary"
              >Kreativstorm's Hands-On Training Program</span
            >, where I receive guidance from an industry professional to explore
            the latest industry trends, technologies, and best practices.
            Simultaneously, I'm honing essential soft skills such as
            communication, leadership, and teamwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            My current focus involves completing courses on React and NodeJS
            through codewithmosh.com and fireship.io. I have completed the HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript courses and have also completed CodePath's Intro
            to Web Development course. This commitment aims to further improve
            my skills and proficiency in these areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion lies in
            <span class="highlight--primary">Front-End Web Development</span>,
            and I am seeking an entry-level position to gain hands-on experience
            and refine my expertise.

                With this project I practiced how to work with an array of objects and how to display the objects as list items. I used updater functions and array methods to properly display content. This project helped me understand React a bit more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also used Tailwind CSS for this project as it has always seemed interesting. It has its pros and cons but I will continue to try it out.

                At first I had trouble understanding React and why it is so
                popular. I am starting to get the hang of it now and it does
                make sites easier to make and maintain. React components are
                like Legos which is pretty cool. I want to remake my Portfolio
                site with React.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had some issues trying to deploy a React + Vite project to
                GitHub but I finally figured it out. I will be working on a
                To-Do List project next.

              <p>
                I expiremented with some fancy border radius styling to create
                some cool unique shapes. I added a scoreboard to keep track of
                the users points and the "computers" points. Ofcourse the
                project works on mobile screens and tablet screens as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                The javascript was both fun and a little bit challenging to
                complete. Making helper functions makes it easier to read the
                code and keep adding features.

                My page was having some performance issues due to large image
                sizes. I remade my site to fix these issues and to use more
                semantic html so that my site can be more maintainable. I also
                made my site responsive as it was lacking in that category
                before.
              </p>
              <p>
                My favorite feature is the cool Dark Mode feature that remains
                persistent. I also changed the styling of my site as I felt it
                was kinda lacking in looks

              <p>
                I remade my Porfolio Website since I felt my old code was messy.
                This time I used Component Based CSS and the techniques and best
                practices that I have learned while taking Kreativstorms
                Hands-On Training Program. I started off by choosing a color
                palette and the typography of my site. I then created components
                and implemented them to my site all while making constant
                commits to my GitHub.

                This is my first project working with APIs. It was challenging
                trying to understand how to select certain data from the JSON
                recieved, but it got interesting once I started to comprehend. I
                expiremented with some glassmorphism and other cool CSS tricks.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am still new to working with APIs but I will continue
                practicing as I understand that working with APIs is a key
                skill.

                This project was my first introduction to C# scripting and JSON.
                Here I demonstrate my ability to work with various types of
                input fields and user provided data to make a Dungeons and
                Dragons style Roll Character menu.

                I gained experience in designing intuitive and user friendly
                interfaces. All the art in this project is original.

                Through this Group Project, I further developed skills in
                project management, teamwork, and communication. I learned the
                importance of version control and clean code. Additionally, I
                acquired valuable experience in implementing game mechanics and
                ensuring a polished user experience.

                My groupmates and I leveled up our abilities to troubleshoot and
                debug.

                This project was my first introduction to Arduino boards. This
                was a group project and although our final code was very simple,
                it was both challenging and fun learning about all the hardware
                mistakes we made along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                My groupmates and I acquired skills in problem-solving,
                research, and adaptability with this project as we encountered
                numerous challenges while working with new parts and
                technologies.

                I learned about microcontrollers in a hands-on way and got to
                experience the many issues one can face with hardware, such as
                using incompatible parts or not connecting wires properly.
