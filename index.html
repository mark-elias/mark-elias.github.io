          <p>
            Hello, my name is Marcos Elias and I recently graduated from San
            Diego State with a <span class="highlight--primary">Bachelors in Computer Science</span>. I like to both
            watch and play sports and I like to play the guitar.
          </p>
          <!-- <p>
            During my time at SDSU, I had the opportunity to work on various
            projects, including Unity game development and Arduino programming.
            Additionally, I took a class that involved challenging Unix/Linux
            labs, which pushed me to become comfortable in a Linux environment.
            I also created a website after completing CodePath's 'Intro to Web
            Development' course.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            Currently, I am enrolled in <span class="highlight--primary">Kreativstorm's Hands-On Training Program</span>, where I receive guidance from an industry professional to explore the latest industry trends, technologies, and best practices. Simultaneously, I'm honing essential soft skills such as communication, leadership, and teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current focus involves completing courses on React and NodeJS through codewithmosh.com and fireship.io. I have completed the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses and have also completed CodePath's Intro to Web Development course. This commitment aims to further improve my skills and proficiency in these areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion lies in <span class="highlight--primary">Front-End Web Development</span>, and I am seeking an entry-level position to gain hands-on experience and refine my expertise.

              This is my first project working with APIs. It was challenging
              trying to understand how to select certain data from the JSON
              recieved, but it got interesting once I started to comprehend. I
              expiremented with some glassmorphism and other cool CSS tricks.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am still new to working with APIs but I will continue practicing
              as I understand that working with APIs is a key skill.

              gained more experience using CSS Grid and FlexBox

              This project was my first introduction to C# scripting and JSON.
              Here I demonstrate my ability to work with various types of input
              fields and user provided data to make a Dungeons and Dragons style
              Roll Character menu.
            </p>
            <p>
              I gained experience in designing intuitive and user friendly
              interfaces. All the art in this project is original.

              Through this Group Project, I further developed skills in project

              polished user experience.

              This project was my first introduction to Arduino boards. This was
              a group project and although our final code was very simple, it
              was both challenging and fun learning about all the hardware
              mistakes we made along the way.

              My groupmates and I acquired skills in problem-solving, research,
