            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, my name is Marcos Elias and I recently graduated from San
              Diego State with a Bachelors in Computer Science. I like to both
              watch and play sports and I like to play the guitar.<br /><br />

              During my time at SDSU, I had the opportunity to work on various
              projects, including Unity game development and Arduino
              programming. Additionally, I took a class that involved
              challenging Unix/Linux labs, which pushed me to become comfortable
              in a Linux environment. I also created a website after completing
              CodePath's 'Intro to Web Development' course.<br /><br />

              Currently, I am dedicating my time to completing the HTML, CSS,
              and JavaScript courses from codewithmosh.com so that I can further
              enhance my skills and gain proficiency.<br /><br />

              I am passionate about Front-End Web Development and I am eager to
              secure an entry-level position so that I can gain experience and
              sharpen my skills.

              My favorite part of this project is the really cool Dark Mode feature I implemented. I focused mainly on making a well designed website, expirementing with box shadows and transformations. I gained more experience using CSS Grid and FlexBox<br><br>
              I still need to learn how to make my website mobile friendly.

              I wanted to showcase my current ability as a web developer as well
              as my passion for web development, and so I made myself this
              Portfolio Website. I applied the skills I have learned so far from
              watching YouTube videos and the lectures I have watched about Web
              Development.<br /><br />
              I will continue to edit and add to this website as I keep learning
              new and better ways to make a website.

              Making my own game was one of my favorite projects to work on.
              Players customize their own rocket ship and must navigate it
              through dangerous asteroids in space.<br /><br />This project
              showcases my proficiency in game development using Unity, C#,
              Visual Studio, and Git/GitHub. I also made all of the art for this
              game.

              This project was my first introduction to C# scripting and JSON.
              Here I demonstrate my ability to work with various types of input
              fields and user provided data to make a Dungeons and Dragons style
              Roll Character menu.<br /><br />I gained experience in designing
              intuitive and user friendly interfaces. All the art in this
              project is original.

              Through this Group Project, I further developed skills in project
              management, teamwork, and communication. I learned the importance
              of version control and clean code. Additionally, I acquired
              valuable experience in implementing game mechanics and ensuring a
              polished user experience.<br /><br />My groupmates and I leveled
              up our abilities to troubleshoot and debug.

              This project was my first introduction to Arduino boards. This was
              a group project and although our final code was very simple, it
              was both challenging and fun learning about all the hardware
              mistakes we made along the way.<br /><br />
              My groupmates and I acquired skills in problem-solving, research,
              and adaptability with this project as we encountered numerous
              challenges while working with new parts and technologies.

              I was the primary contributor for this Arduino group project, I
              took initiative to lead in its development and completed a
              majority of the tasks.<br /><br />
              I learned about microcontrollers in a hands-on way and got to
              experience the many issues one can face with hardware, such as
              using incompatible parts or not connecting wires properly.
